When you’re buying a house, the only way to know its true condition is by getting a professional home inspector out there. **They will check for leaks, structural damage, and any other health and safety issues that you might not see.**

If you’re getting a mortgage, a home inspection isn’t necessarily required. The lender actually relies on the appraiser more. If an appraiser identifies issues, they know they have a problem and will request an inspection. Otherwise, there’s no purpose in providing one unless they ask for it.

When it comes to insurance, that’s a different story. You’re definitely going to want to have a wind mitigation inspection and potentially a four-point inspection. A wind mitigation is going to cover the things that would relate to hurricane damage. They will look at whether you have shutters, impact windows, or your roof is strapped on properly.

**A four-point inspection will be required if the house is over 25 or 30 years old.** This will look at the electric, plumbing, roof, HVAC, and ventilation in the property.

Although an inspection is not generally required, I always recommend getting one. According to the National Association of Realtors, 85% of buyers are getting home inspections. This is one of the times where I completely agree with the majority.

If you have any other questions about home inspections or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
