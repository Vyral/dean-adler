*We’ve opened a new branch in Sunrise, Florida, and this means great changes for you\!*

I have an exciting announcement\! **I’ve had a unique opportunity to open a brand new branch with Hamilton Group Funding in Sunrise, Florida\!**

We have over 30,000 square feet available here. So, what does this mean for you? My branch is 20 feet away from the underwriting department; if I walk down the hall a bit I’ve got the marketing department, further down the hall is the closing department and the funding department. Everything is under one roof. All departments are close, and we’re able to help you get through the loan process as quickly and efficiently as possible.&nbsp;

I’ve also been able to keep my original team intact, as well as grow it further. One of the biggest reasons for this change is that Hamilton Group Funding has a product that enables us to have no fees for my prior clients, as well as a product called Hamilton Heroes which requires no lender fees for policemen, firemen, and veterans.&nbsp;

So, **prior clients, policemen, firemen, and veterans will receive no lender fees, underwriting, doc prep, or application fees.** A savings of $1,500 or more immediately\!

If you have any questions whatsoever please give me a call or send me an email. We’d love to answer them.
