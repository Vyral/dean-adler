Today’s question comes from Mr. Richard Fader of Fort Lee, New Jersey. Richard’s question is one I’m sure we’ve all wondered at some point: “What can I do about all of the junk mail I receive?” That’s a great question, and, thankfully, there is something you can do to cut back the spam and keep your mailbox clutter-free.&nbsp;

The main issue is that Equifax, Transunion, and Experion are selling our information to lenders, credit card companies, and insurance companies.&nbsp;

You have a couple of ways you can remove your name from the mailing lists that junk-mail senders rely on:&nbsp;

**1\. Visit [www.optoutprescreen.com](https://www.optoutprescreen.com/){: target="_blank"}.** This web portal, run by the three major credit bureaus I mentioned earlier, allows you to opt out for a five-year period or for life.&nbsp;

**2\. Call 888-5OP-TOUT (888-567-8688).** This number will direct you to the same portal as the website I mentioned earlier. However, by calling this line, you can only choose to opt out for a five-year period. Be prepared to answer a few personal questions when you make this call. But don’t worry—this information will never be shared, however, and will simply be used to remove you from their mailing lists.&nbsp;

Not only does opting out of junk mail keep your mailbox neat and tidy, but it also helps protect you against identity fraud—as junk mail is a common target for those seeking to steal personal information.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;
