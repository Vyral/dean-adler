Dale Carnegie once said that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest, most important sound in any language.&nbsp;

I took a Dale Carnegie class when I was 22 years old, and the first night we practiced memorizing names. There were 50 people in that class, and **they taught us a technique that helped me to remember all 50 names by the end of the night.**&nbsp;

Someone recently asked me for help with remembering names to spare them any embarrassment during social events. Today I’ll share a simplified version of that technique to help you master the art of remembering names.

**Mr. Carnegie looks at three different things to help him remember names:**

1. Truly listen to the person when they say their name.
2. Repeat the person’s name as you look them in the eye.
3. Come up with a visual to associate with their name. For my part, I was “Dean, Dean, the Jumping Jellybean;” if you made the jellybean purple, so much the better. People would envision me jumping up and down to help them remember my name, and it worked\!

While I was researching names and memorization, I came across a lot of very interesting and unusual names—**names that you probably wouldn’t have a difficult time remembering if you met that person:**

* Crystal Ball
* Kash Register
* Filet Minyon
* Donald Duck
* Brock Lee
* Chris P. Bacon
